# Month Maker
This PowerShell script generates a series of directories representing each month of the year. 

## How It Works:
- A folder selection dialog pops up, allowing the user to choose where the monthly directories will be created.
- The script automatically generates folders named in the format "01, January", "02, February", etc., inside the selected folder.
- If the folder already exists, it skips creation to avoid duplicates.
- A confirmation message appears once the process is complete.

This script is useful for organizing files by month in a structured way.

## How to Use the Script
1. Download `month-maker.ps1` script to the location you want to generate the directories.
2. Right click and **Run with PowerShell**
